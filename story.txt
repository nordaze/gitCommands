It tells the story of a race between a tortoise (= a creature that moves very slowly) and a hare (= a creature that can run very fast). The hare is very confident of winning, so it stops during the race and falls asleep. The tortoise continues to move very slowly but without stopping and finally it wins the race.
The Tortoise and the Hare" is one of Aesop's Fables and is numbered 226 in the Perry Index. The account of a race between unequal partners has attracted conflicting interpretations. 
The fable itself is a variant of a common folktale theme in which ingenuity and trickery are employed to overcome a stronger opponent.
